# C++ Programming Repository

Welcome to the C++ Programming Repository! This repository contains a collection of code examples covering various aspects of the C++ programming language.

## Contents

- **Basic Programming Structure**: Understand the fundamental building blocks of C++ programs.
- **Variables**: Learn about different types of variables and how to use them effectively.
- **Functions**: Explore function definitions, declarations, and how to use them in your code.
- **Conditionals**: Master if statements, switch cases, and other control flow mechanisms.
- **Loops**: Get to grips with different looping constructs such as for, while, and do-while loops.
- **Data Structures**: Arrays, vectors, matrices, and other data structures.
- **Pointers**: Learn about pointers, dynamic memory allocation, and memory management.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Discover the principles of OOP, including classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
- **Memory Allocation**: Understand dynamic memory allocation and deallocation techniques.
- **Headers and Macros**: Learn about separating code into header files, using macros.

## Getting Started

To get started with the code examples, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/guilhermepolesi/cpp-programming.git
    ```

2. **Navigate into the Directory**

    ```bash
    cd cpp-programming
    ```

3. **Compile on Linux**

    To compile the C++ code on Linux using `g++` (from the GCC package), use the following command:

    ```bash
    g++ -o output main.cpp
    ```

    You can then run the compiled program with:

    ```bash
    ./output
    ```

4. **Compile on Windows**

    If you're using the `g++` compiler from MinGW on Windows, follow these steps:

    - Open the MinGW Command Prompt.
    - Navigate to your project directory:

      ```cmd
      cd path\to\cpp-programmig
      ```

    - Compile the code with:

      ```cmd
      g++ -o output.exe main.cpp
      ```

    - Run the executable:

      ```cmd
      output.exe
      ```
